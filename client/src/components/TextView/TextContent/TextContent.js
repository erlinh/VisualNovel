          I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
          autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very
          stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an
          apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled
          me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me. "You could
          not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said
          cordially. "I was afraid that you were engaged." "So I am. Very much
          so." "Then I can wait in the next room." "Not at all. This gentleman,
          Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most
          successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost
          use to me in yours also." The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
          and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance
          from his small fat-encircled eyes. "Try the settee," said Holmes,
          relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as
          was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that
          you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions
          and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for
          it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you
          will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own
          little adventures." "Your cases have indeed been of the greatest
          interest to me," I observed. "You will remember that I remarked the
          other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented
          by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary
          combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more
          daring than any effort of the imagination."

          We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his
          neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he
          had gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was
          corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of
          the house together with the rent due, in English money. This had been
          between ten and eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill
          again. Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped
          out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the
          churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if
          by some wild animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see
          the horror, the women crying out "This is the work of a Slovak!" We
          hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the
          affair, and so detained. As we came home we could arrive at no
          definite conclusion. We were all convinced that the box was on its
          way, by water, to somewhere; but where that might be we would have to
          discover. With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina. When we
          met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina again
          into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at least
          a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was
          released from my promise to her. 30 October, evening.--They were so
          tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done
          till they had some rest; so I asked them all to lie down for half an
          hour whilst I should enter everything up to the moment. I feel so
          grateful to the man who invented the "Traveller's" typewriter, and to
          Mr. Morris for getting this one for me.
